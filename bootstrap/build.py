"""
Bangkok Post Blueprint — build.

ONE file is edited:

    BLUEPRINT.txt     markdown throughout, register fenced as YAML inside it

Five are derived from it and never touched by hand:

    GUIDE.txt         the operating manual, part delivery for /guide
    PROCESSES.txt     the G4 operational section, part delivery for /processes
    DIRECTORY.yaml    the lookups, part delivery for /dir
    DIRECTORY.txt     DIRECTORY.yaml under a .txt extension, byte-identical
    BLUEPRINT.pdf     the rendered artifact of record

The extension is inert. Nothing in the chain reads it: pandoc is told the
format explicitly and raw.githubusercontent serves every extension as
text/plain. The markdown SYNTAX is load-bearing and is not optional — it is
what makes headings headings in the rendered volume.

The register travels verbatim. Between the seam and the fence the bytes are
the register exactly, which is what makes the split reversible: cut on the
seam, strip the fence, restore the comment seam, and DIRECTORY.yaml is back.
The invertibility guard below checks that on every build.

BLUEPRINT.pdf is downstream. Rendered, never edited.

Run:  python3 build.py
