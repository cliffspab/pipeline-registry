"""
Close the loop after a push: wait for the compile job, pull its output, and
seal the edition.

The Word volume is NOT built locally. build.py writes the parts and the PDF;
tools/build_bkp_compendium.py builds the docx and it runs inside the compile
job. Building it here as well would mean pushing a docx that CI immediately
rebuilds and commits over — a binary conflict on the next rebase, for nothing.

So the docx comes back rather than going out. This waits for compile-bot to
commit, rebases onto it, checks the volume carries the current build tag, and
copies the edition into Editions\\<tag>\\.

    python3 seal.py             wait for CI, pull, seal
    python3 seal.py --no-wait   pull and seal whatever is already on origin

Run it from push.bat after a confirmed push, or by hand any time afterwards —
it is idempotent and safe to repeat.

NOT A QUALITY GATE. The design spec keeps two checks off the machine: Word on
Windows is the authoritative renderer for pagination, and the accessibility
audit is manual. A sealed volume is a build artifact, not an approved one.
