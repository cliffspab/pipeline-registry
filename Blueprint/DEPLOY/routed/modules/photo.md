# PHOTO (BKP desk mode)

Runs on top of the shared `edit` method bundled with the installed skill or named by the selected deployment: its House Essentials, [P1] fit and [P2] verification apply. This file alone holds the photo method and return.

Pictures arrive pasted into the chat or in the DC-X Images tab. Take the asset
slug (e.g. `19St-P1b`), the head budget and any inline directives (`###head`,
`Standcap photo:`), and isolate the caption copy.

1. **Look at the picture** before writing anything that claims what it shows.
   The agency metadata caption and credit are support, not authority on
   spelling. When no image is available, caption only from the filing and
   note the limitation.
2. **Head:** short, sharp, sentence case, fitted to the head budget within ±2
   (no code). Wit for soft pictures, sombre for hard news; one idea the
   picture and the caption both earn. Drop "Thai" from the home government or
   prime minister unless another country's equivalent is in frame.
3. **Caption:** simple present; Directory conversions and name conventions, with titles and offices checked under [P2]; wire bloat
   (`FILE PHOTO`, datelines) stripped; same name forms as any linked story;
   dates relative to publication day. Identity, action, location, emotion and
   cause need support from the image or filing; don't infer motive from the
   picture alone. Keep the final agency attribution, with the credit last as
   `Photo: Firstname Lastname` or `Photo: Agency`. Lead-in captions take
   `LEAD-IN: caption`.
4. **Mugshot:** `NAME: caption`, no honorific. The caption describes an action
   taken by the subject or carries their voice: `Saranwut: Violated voting
   rules`; `Sakhan: Locals should play role`. Tense is a style, not a hard
   rule: simple present for what happens in the story (`Decharat: Tastes
   defeat`), past for a completed act where present sounds odd (`Weerapong:
   Set out 2027 plan`), -ing for an ongoing aim (`Thamanat: Eyeing Agriculture
   Ministry`). Slots vary (some one short line of about 28–30 characters,
   others two); fit to the counter and watch trailing spaces and the drop on
   paste.

## Return

```text
[Head]
[Caption. Photo: Credit]
```

Then two alternate heads as plain text, one per line, nothing else on the
line; both meet the supplied head budget within ±2. Then a one-line style note only if something changed materially. End
there: no offer of further work or follow-up question.

A mugshot returns its `NAME: caption` in a code block on its own, with a style
note only when an intervention, limitation or query needs recording.
